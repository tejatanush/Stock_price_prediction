### Applications  
* Stock price prediction models are used in algorithmic trading to automate the buying and selling of stocks. By predicting short-term price movements, algorithms can 
  execute trades at optimal times, maximizing profit and minimizing risk.
* Investors and fund managers use stock price prediction models to optimize their portfolios. By forecasting future stock prices, they can make informed decisions on asset 
  allocation, balancing risk and return to achieve financial goals.
* Financial institutions use stock price prediction to assess and manage risk. By predicting potential price fluctuations, they can develop strategies to hedge against 
  adverse market movements, protecting investments and ensuring financial stability.
